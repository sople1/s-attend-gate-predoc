# AI-Analytics Integration

This document defines the integration points between AI and Analytics components.

## Integration Overview

The AI and Analytics systems are tightly integrated to provide:
- Real-time data processing
- Machine learning model training
- Predictive analytics
- Behavioral analysis
- Performance optimization

## Integration Points

### Data Flow
1. Analytics collects and preprocesses data
2. AI systems consume processed data for model training
3. ML models generate predictions and insights
4. Analytics system visualizes AI outputs
5. Both systems share monitoring metrics

### Shared Components

#### Data Pipeline
- Raw data collection (Analytics)
- Data preprocessing (Analytics)
- Feature extraction (AI)
- Model training (AI)
- Results storage (Analytics)

#### APIs
- Data ingestion API
- Model prediction API
- Results retrieval API
- Monitoring API

## Performance Requirements

- Maximum latency: 100ms for real-time predictions
- Batch processing: Up to 1M records per hour
- Model update frequency: Daily
- Data sync delay: < 5 minutes
